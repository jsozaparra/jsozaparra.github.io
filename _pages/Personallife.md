## fibromyalgia
<p align="justify">
In june 2019, right during the last strecht of my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/g6y77p/i_have_just_got_my_phd_its_possible/">graduate studies</a>, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition that causes widespread pain and tenderness in the muscles, joints, and soft tissues of the body  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201522">(HÃ¤user et al., 2015)</a>. It can also cause fatigue, sleep problems, cognitive difficulties, and brain fog. The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but it is believed to involve a complex interaction between genetic, environmental, and psychological factors  <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/1860480">(Holton et al., 2010)</a>. For me fibromyalgia feels like having constantly a hiking bag on my shoulders, neck, and back. The brain fog, or this hazy feeling in your brain that makes it hard to focus, also hits me from time to time. It makes things quite hard when trying to concentrate on meetings or on any academic task. A common way to explain how it feels to others is the "Spoon Theory", in which daily tasks consume certain amounts of spoons with the following catch: you don't start each day with the same amount, and doing too much can affect the number of spoons you have the following day (<i>see below</i>).  
These findings suggest that dietary glutamate may be contributing to FM symptoms in some patients <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590010002373">(Clauw, 2014)</a>

This is an example post with image galleries.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="https://me-pedia.org/images/9/99/Spoon-theory.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true%}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all. Sourves to the images <a href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory">here</a> and <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/fibromyalgia-symptoms-716139">here.</a>
