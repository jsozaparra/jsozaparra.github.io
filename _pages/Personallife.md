## fibromyalgia
<p align="justify">
Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition that causes widespread pain and tenderness in the muscles, joints, and soft tissues of the body  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201522">(HÃ¤user et al., 2015)</a>. It can also cause fatigue, sleep problems, cognitive difficulties, and brain fog. The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but it is believed to involve a complex interaction between genetic, environmental, and psychological factors  <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/1860480">(Holton et al., 2010)</a>.
These findings suggest that dietary glutamate may be contributing to FM symptoms in some patients <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590010002373">(Clauw, 2014)</a>
