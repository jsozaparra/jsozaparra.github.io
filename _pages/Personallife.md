## fibromyalgia
<p align="justify">
By the end of 2015 I was about to get my Transportation Engineering professional title when I started to see myself working in academia in the near future. As I wanted to make some kind of contribution to my home town’s public transport system, I decided to enrol the PhD program in the Department of Transportation Engineering and Logistics, at PUC, Chile, under the supervision of Juan Carlos Muñoz and Sebastián Raveau.<br><br>
During 2016 I worked defining my dissertation research, which ended up focused on the causes and effects of public transport reliability. In August, I also had the chance to participate in the “Modeling and Simulation of Transportation Networks” MIT short course, as well as to attend the TransitData16 conference in Boston.


These findings suggest that dietary glutamate may be contributing to FM symptoms in some patients <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590010002373">(Holton et al., 2010)</a>

This is an example post with image galleries.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="https://me-pedia.org/images/9/99/Spoon-theory.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true%}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="https://www.verywellhealth.com/thmb/x26bvm2-3ufDYG8IBrTXGZzbSZ0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fibromyalgia-symptoms-5aec9feceb97de003668abb7.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all. Sourves to the images <a href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory">here</a> and <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/fibromyalgia-symptoms-716139">here.</a>
</div>

Images can be made zoomable.
Simply add `data-zoomable` to `<img>` tags that you want to make zoomable.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/10.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>

The rest of the images in this post are all zoomable, arranged into different mini-galleries.
