My <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">`academic-name`</abbr> is Jaime Soza-Parra, I was born in Chile and did my PhD there as well, at the Transport Engineering and Logistics Department, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. During my second PhD year, I performed a 10 months external research stay in TU Delft Transportation and Planning Department as a visiting <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Hello, this is the tooltip"> Try hover over me </span> PhD student. Since then, I worked as a Postdoc Researcher at CEDEUS first, and later as a Postdoc Researcher at UC Davis. Right now I am back at Delft working as a Postdoc Researcher at TU Delft and also as a Research fellow at the Amsterdam Institute for Metropolitan Solutions.

My research interests focus on the analysis of different data sources, from passively collected (e.g. smartcard information) to surveys (e.g. discrete choice stated preference surveys) to understand how uncertainty impacts travellers behaviour.

I am also concerned about cities increasing growth rate and its sustainability implications. Thus, I see public transportation and active transport as the alternatives the promote. To do so, I think it is also quite important to understand private-car driver's attitudes towards mobility, especially on how to encourage a fairer use of the space.
